You should, it's awesome\nUh, so I just want to be honest about where I'm at and I wanna thank you guys for your loyalty over the years and I wanna thank you again for coming to my show tonight\nAnd this song\nI feel much better now that I just was honest and I told you that I'm fucking scared up here\nThis song is called \"Never Be Me\"\nThis song is off my newest record called Plastic Hearts\nAnd I've never sang this song before live, so I look forward to doing it for y'allEmbed", "acousticness": 0.165, "danceability": 0.549, "duration_ms": 534337, "energy": 0.788, "instrumentalness": 0, "key": 2, "liveness": 0.791, "loudness": -5.524, "mode": 1, "speechiness": 0.142, "tempo": 140.045, "time_signature": 4, "valence": 0.216}, {"name": "Never Be Me - Live", "id": "4eP4Ix99JSn0lBZ2goUESe", "lyrics": "Never Be Me - Live Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI know I do this every time\nI walk the line, I play with fire\nAnd I stop myself before the crime\nI walk the line, yeah, I play with fire\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna push you way too much\nI don't wanna lean that way too far\nI don't wanna ever learn the hard way\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me\nIf you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me\nIf you're looking for someone to be all that you need\nThat'll never be me\n(Hard as I try)\nThat'll never be m\u0435\n(I play with fire)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDry your tears now, don't you cry\nI'm by your side, at l\u0435ast for a while\nI know I do this every time\nI walk the line, yeah, I play with fire\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna push you way too much\nI don't wanna lean that way too far\nI don't wanna ever learn the hard way, no\nI don't wanna keep you in the dark\nI don't wanna gamble with your heart\nI don't wanna ever leave you lonely\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me\nIf you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me\nIf you're looking for someone to be all that you need\nThat'll never be me\n(Hard as I try)\nThat'll never be me\n(I play with fire)\n\n[Bridge]\nCan't get too close to the sun (Fire)\nBaby, you're the only one, oh, I\nI'd never lie to you, baby, oh (Fire)\nYou give me a reason to run from the fire\n'Cause baby, you're the only one\nOh, I swear I'd never lie\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're looking for stable, that'll never be me\nBut I hope that I'm able to be all that you need\nIf you think that I'm someone to give up and leave\nThat'll never be me, no\nIf you think that I'm someone to give up and leave\nThat'll never be me\n(Hard as I try)\nThat'll never be me, no\n(I play with fire)\nThat'll never be meEmbed", "acousticness": 0.017, "danceability": 0.379, "duration_ms": 213812, "energy": 0.83, "instrumentalness": 0, "key": 1, "liveness": 0.747, "loudness": -4.342, "mode": 0, "speechiness": 0.0485, "tempo": 82.802, "time_signature": 4, "valence": 0.354}, {"name": "Maybe - Live", "id": "22FTbEh8FVYWeX6SOHBMeZ", "lyrics": "Maybe - Live Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMaybe\nOh, if I could pray and to try, dear\nThen you might come back home to me\nHome to me\nMaybe, oh\nIf I could ever hold your little hand\nWoah, then you might try to understand\nOoh, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, maybe\nOh, maybe, maybe, maybe\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe, maybe\nMaybe, maybe, maybe, maybe\nDear, I might have done something wrong and, honey\nHoney, I'd be glad to admit it\nYou come on home to me\nWon't you come back home to me?\nOh, honey\n[Chorus]\nOh, maybe\nOh, maybe, maybe, mayb\u0435\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I know that it just doesn't ev\u0435r seem to matter, baby\nAnd, oh, honey\nWhen I get out, you know what I'm tryna do\nCan't you just see that I'm still left here?\nAnd I'm holding on and I, oh, I need you\nOh, so please, please, please, oh\nOh, won't you reconsider?

those who wait\nIt\u2019s like countin' in light years\nI'd physically live without you, but I don't want to\nAnd death's never been my fear\nYou can take my blood, take my bones\nMy heart is yours, I volunteer\nBut how can I miss you so much when you're right here?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you look up at a rainbow\nDo you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?\nI don't want no gold, nothing\u2019s more than you\nThe amount is hard to even comprehend\nNothing I can do, I lost control\nSomething we hold on to so dear\nBut how can I miss you so much when you\u2019re right here?\n[Verse 3]\nAnd how at this optimal time did you just appear?\nEveryone under their guard, so full of shit\nBut you are just so sheer\nYou're my God, you\u2019re my faith\nOn my knees, I look at you and I revere\nBut how can I miss you so much when you're right here?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you look up at the cosmos\nDo you ever wonder if there's really even an end?\nIt might go on forever, like my love for you\nAn amount that's hard to even comprehend\nI won\u2019t waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear\nBut how can I miss you so much when you're right here?\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou're my God, you're my faith\nOn my knees, I look at you and I revere\nYou can take my blood, take my bones\nMy heart is yours, I volunteer\nBut how can I miss you so much when you're right here?\nBut how can I miss you so much when you're right here?19Embed", "acousticness": 0.0248, "danceability": 0.394, "duration_ms": 293747, "energy": 0.506, "instrumentalness": 7.12e-06, "key": 7, "liveness": 0.372,

fucked up, but\nAlright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude\nAnd then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again\nThis whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place\nI mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be\nAnd you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou're giving me a feeling in my head\nLaying in my bed just thinking\nNot really feeling like the one I want\nTakes everything in me not to call him\nI really, really, really want it, too\nI told all my friends I'm moving on\nYour baby talk is creeping me out\nFuck me so you stop baby talking\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat\nI mean, even in front of your mom\nDude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough\nI mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch\nYou know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do\nYou know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo\n[Chorus 2]\nYou keep saying again and again\nWe're laying in my bed just talking\nAnd now I, now I can't hold it back\nI'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit\nI don't really wanna let go of you\nI heard I change my mind way too often\nYour baby talk is creeping me out\nFuck me so you stop baby talking\n\n[Verse 3]\nAlright, so, I'm gonna be honest\nIt's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here\nI mean, I'm fucking what?\nLook, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me\nI mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth\nLike, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do\nAnd remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...\nWell, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world\nYou know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck\nI'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit\nI mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo\n\n[Chorus 3]\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nFuck me so you'll stop baby
