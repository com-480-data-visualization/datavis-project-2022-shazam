Adkins/Greg Kurstin\n[00:02.62]Composed by：Adele Adkins/Greg Kurstin\n[00:03.79]\n[00:16.42]How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes\n[00:24.22]How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like\n[00:31.23]\n[00:32.75]We're in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us down\n[00:39.68]\n[00:40.53]By putting ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow\n[00:47.70]\n[00:49.76]When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind\n[00:56.23]\n[00:56.94]Soaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine\n[01:03.63]\n[01:05.70]They say to play hard you work hard find balance in the sacrifice\n[01:12.69]\n[01:13.46]And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied\n[01:20.74]\n[01:21.82]You better believe I'm trying\n[01:24.08]Trying trying\n[01:26.64]To keep climbing\n[01:28.20]Climbing climbing\n[01:30.75]But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser\n[01:35.68]Ah ah ah ah\n[01:38.44]So I hope I learn to get over myself\n[01:45.22]\n[01:46.16]Stop trying to be somebody else\n[01:54.06]\n[01:55.03]So we can love each other for free\n[02:02.30]\n[02:02.81]Everybody wants something you just want me\n[02:10.78]\n[02:12.59]Why am I obsessing about the things I can't control\n[02:18.85]\n[02:19.87]Why am I seeking approval from people I don't even know\n[02:26.86]\n[02:28.57]In these crazy times I hope to find something I can cling onto\n[02:36.30]'Cause I need some substance in my life\n[02:39.17]Something real something that feels true\n[02:43.32]\n[02:44.58]You better believe for you I've cried\n[02:46.97]I've cried I've cried\n[02:49.62]High tides\n[02:51.05]High tides high tides\n[02:53.68]'Cause I want you so bad but you can't fight fire with fire\n[02:58.25]Ah ah ah ah\n[03:00.59]Oh-oh oh-oh\n[03:01.51]I hope I learn to get over myself\n[03:07.51]\n[03:08.97]Stop trying to be somebody else\n[03:16.39]\n[03:17.05]Oh I just want to love you love you for free\n[03:24.49]\n[03:25.58]Everybody wants something from me you just want me\n[03:33.27]\n[03:34.73]Listen I know how low I can go I give as good as I get\n[03:42.13]\n[03:43.89]You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left\n[03:50.19]\n[03:51.53]Oh I hope in time\n[03:53.24]Hope in time\n[03:54.20]We both will find\n[03:55.26]We'll both find\n[03:55.91]Peace of mind\n[03:58.31]\n[03:59.32]Sometimes the road less traveled is the road best left behind\n[04:04.61]Ah ah ah ah\n[04:06.77]Well so I hope I learn to get over myself\n[04:14.29]\n[04:15.26]Stop trying to be somebody else\n[04:23.47]Oh I just want to love you love you for free yeah\n[04:31.25]\n[04:31.83]'Cause everybody wants something from me you just want

the wiser\n[04:56.41]\n[05:22.69]The only regret I have\n[05:24.88]\n[05:28.56]I wish that it was just at a different time\n[05:30.36]\n[05:32.80]A most turbulent period of my life\n[05:35.36]\n[05:39.56]Why would I put that on you\n[05:40.90]\n[05:43.18]That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about\n[05:46.24]\n[05:49.21]But because of that period of time\n[05:51.03]\n[05:52.22]Even though it was so much fun\n[05:53.65]\n[05:56.30]I didn't get to go on and to make new memories with him\n[05:59.01]\n[06:02.31]There was just memories in a big
