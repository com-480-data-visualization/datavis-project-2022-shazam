Schmalholz/Tim James\n[00:03.65]Composed by：Antonina Armato/Thomas Sturges/Adam Schmalholz/Tim James\n[00:05.47]I'm so tired of pretending pretending\n[00:08.53]Where's my happy ending\n[00:11.26]I followed all the rules\n[00:12.64]I drew inside the lines\n[00:14.02]I never asked for anything that wasn't mine\n[00:16.51]I waited patiently for my time\n[00:18.01]But when it finally came\n[00:19.47]He called her name\n[00:21.14]And now I feel this overwhelming pain\n[00:23.29]I mean it's in my veins\n[00:24.67]I mean it's in my brain\n[00:26.12]My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train\n[00:28.83]I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame\n[00:31.55]I know exactly who to blame\n[00:34.28]I never thought of myself as mean\n[00:39.61]I always thought that I'd be the queen queen\n[00:43.29]And there's no in between\n[00:45.35]'Cause if I can't have that\n[00:46.92]Then I would be the leader of the dark\n[00:48.78]And the bad\n[00:50.21]Now there's a devil on my shoulder\n[00:51.49]Where the angels used to be\n[00:53.82]And it's calling me the queen\n[00:57.99]Being nice was my pastime pastime\n[01:00.71]But I've been hurt for the last time last time\n[01:03.55]And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me\n[01:06.46]The anger burns my skin third-degree\n[01:08.89]Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea\n[01:11.72]There's nobody getting close to me\n[01:13.58]They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen\n[01:15.79]Your nightmare's my dream\n[01:17.36]Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes\n[01:21.26]I never thought of myself as mean\n[01:26.76]I always thought that I'd be the queen queen\n[01:30.18]And there's no in between\n[01:32.25]'Cause if I can't have that\n[01:33.94]Then I would be the leader of the dark\n[01:35.67]And the bad\n[01:37.09]Now there's a devil on my shoulder\n[01:38.35]Where the angels used to be\n[01:40.74]And he's calling me the queen of mean calling me calling me\n[01:44.35]The queen of mean calling me calling me\n[01:49.00]Calling me calling me\n[01:49.53]The queen of mean\n[01:53.42]Something's pulling me\n[01:55.00]It's so magnetic\n[01:56.11]My body is moving\n[01:57.38]Unsure where I'm headed\n[01:58.83]All of my senses have left me defenseless\n[02:01.45]This darkness around me\n[02:02.56]Is promising vengeance\n[02:04.38]The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive\n[02:06.92]There's nothing to lose\n[02:08.07]When you're lonely and friendless\n[02:09.62]So my only interest is showing this princess\n[02:12.48]That I am the queen\n[02:13.57]And my reign will be endless endless endless\n[02:17.35]I want what I deserve\n[02:20.04]I want to rule the world\n[02:22.74]Sit back and watch them learn\n[02:26.18]It's finally my turn\n[02:30.17]If they want a villain for a queen\n[02:35.72]I'm gonna be one like they've never seen\n[02:39.19]I'll show them what it means\n[02:41.48]Now that I am that\n[02:43.01]I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad\n[02:46.26]'Cause the devil's on my shoulder\n[02:47.43]Where the angels used to be\n[02:49.71]And he's calling me the queen of mean calling me calling
