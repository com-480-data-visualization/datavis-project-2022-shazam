Rose\n[00:03.31]Composed by：Taylor Swift/Liz Rose\n[00:04.97]I walked through the door with you\n[00:07.20]\n[00:07.76]The air was cold\n[00:10.18]But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow\n[00:14.51]And I left my scarf there at your sister's house\n[00:19.90]And you've still got it in your drawer even now\n[00:25.71]\n[00:35.53]Oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze\n[00:40.57]\n[00:41.16]We're singing in the car getting lost upstate\n[00:45.85]\n[00:46.36]Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\n[00:50.48]And I can picture it after all these days\n[00:56.55]And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more\n[01:01.71]And I might be ok but I'm not fine at all\n[01:11.37]\n[01:12.28]Cause there we are again on that\n[01:14.89]Little town street\n[01:16.75]\n[01:17.37]You almost ran the red\n[01:19.01]Cause you were looking over at me\n[01:21.60]Wind in my hair I was there\n[01:24.30]I remember it all too well\n[01:29.97]\n[01:32.25]Photo album on the counter\n[01:34.61]\n[01:35.39]Your cheeks were turning red\n[01:37.29]You used to be a little kid with glasses\n[01:39.63]In a twin-sized bed\n[01:42.80]And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on\n[01:45.74]The tee ball team\n[01:47.33]\n[01:48.17]You taught me 'bout your past\n[01:50.03]Thinkin' your future was me\n[01:52.58]And you were tossing me the car keys\n[01:55.44]'F**k the patriarchy' keychain on the ground\n[01:58.83]\n[01:59.58]We were always skipping town\n[02:01.75]\n[02:02.71]And I was thinking on the drive down\n[02:05.60]Any time now he's gonna say it's love\n[02:09.52]You never called it what it was\n[02:11.98]\n[02:12.80]'Til we were dead and gone and buried\n[02:15.62]Check the pulse and come back\n[02:17.39]Swearing it's the same after 3 months in the grave\n[02:22.07]\n[02:22.96]And then you wondered where it went to\n[02:25.99]As I reached for you but\n[02:27.61]All I felt was shame\n[02:30.09]And you held my lifeless frame\n[02:33.40]And I know it's long gone and\n[02:36.28]There was nothing else I could do\n[02:38.90]And I forget about you long enough\n[02:41.47]To forget why I needed to\n[02:48.75]\n[02:49.42]Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\n[02:53.71]\n[02:54.59]We're dancin' round the kitchen in the\n[02:56.98]Refrigerator light\n[02:58.99]Down the stairs I was there\n[03:01.38]I remember it all too well\n[03:07.71]\n[03:09.85]And there we are again\n[03:11.73]When nobody had to know\n[03:14.49]\n[03:15.15]You kept me like a secret\n[03:17.14]But I kept you like an oath\n[03:19.62]Sacred prayer and we'd swear\n[03:22.14]To remember it all too well\n[03:28.42]\n[03:30.31]Yeah\n[03:31.26]\n[03:45.30]Well maybe we got lost in translation\n[03:48.44]Maybe I asked for too much\n[03:50.62]But maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n[03:53.62]'Til you tore it all up\n[03:55.78]Running scared I was there\n[03:58.35]I remember it all too well\n[04:06.21]And you call me up again\n[04:08.92]Just to break me like a promise\n[04:12.01]So casually cruel in the name of being honest\n[04:16.71]I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n[04:21.07]Cause I remember it all all all\n[04:27.24]They say all's well that ends well\n[04:30.16]But I'm in a new hell every time\n[04:33.25]\n[04:34.63]You double-cross my mind\n[04:37.89]You said if we had been closer in age\n[04:41.37]Maybe it would have been fine\n[04:44.10]\n[04:45.03]And that made me want to die\n[04:48.23]The idea you had of me\n[04:50.32]Who was she\n[04:51.18]A never-needy ever lovely jewel\n[04:54.71]Whose shine reflects on you\n[04:58.61]Not weeping in a party bathroom\n[05:01.24]Some actress asking me what happened\n[05:03.80]You\n[05:04.27]\n[05:05.34]That's what happened：You\n[05:08.79]Who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\n[05:14.01]Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show\n[05:18.92]Then he watched me watch the front door\n[05:21.35]All night willing you to come\n[05:23.98]And he said \"it's supposed to be fun\n[05:26.67]\n[05:27.44]Turning 21\"\n[05:29.82]\n[05:43.73]Time won't fly\n[05:45.35]It's like I'm paralyzed by it\n[05:48.62]I'd like to be my old self again\n[05:51.30]But I'm still trying to find it\n[05:53.62]After plaid shirt days\n[05:55.83]And nights when you made me your own\n[05:58.51]\n[05:59.19]Now you mail back my things\n[06:00.99]And I walk home alone\n[06:04.58]But you keep my old scarf\n[06:06.80]From that very first week\n[06:09.59]Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\n[06:13.95]\n[06:14.52]You can't get rid of it\n[06:16.00]\n[06:16.93]Cause you remember it all too well\n[06:23.16]Yeah\n[06:24.32]\n[06:25.08]Cause there we are again when\n[06:27.35]I loved you so\n[06:29.61]\n[06:30.55]Back before you lost the one real thing\n[06:33.31]You've ever known\n[06:35.06]It was rare I was there\n[06:37.25]I remember it all too well\n[06:43.80]\n[06:45.22]Wind in my hair you were there\n[06:47.70]You remember it all\n[06:50.27]Down the stairs you were there\n[06:52.88]You remember it all\n[06:55.96]It was rare I was there\n[06:58.40]I remember it all too well\n[07:03.87]\n[07:05.24]And I was never good at telling jokes\n[07:09.27]But the punchline goes：\n[07:11.16]\"I'll get older but your lovers stay my age\"\n[07:16.50]From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\n[07:21.19]I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\n[07:26.33]And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue\n[07:31.27]\n[07:31.84]Just between us did the love affair maim you too\n[07:36.88]Cause in this city's barren cold\n[07:40.56]I still remember the first fall of snow\n[07:45.87]And how it glistened as it fell\n[07:48.82]\n[07:50.01]I remember it all too well\n[07:54.07]\n[07:57.48]Just between us did the love affair maim you\n[08:01.53]All too well\n[08:06.40]\n[08:07.61]Just between us do you remember it\n[08:11.66]All too well\n[08:16.13]\n[08:17.46]Just between us I remember it all too well\n[08:25.24]\n[08:32.77]Wind in my hair\n[08:34.57]I was there I was there\n[08:36.61]\n[08:38.16]Down the stairs I was there\n[08:40.46]I was there\n[08:42.02]\n[08:43.04]Sacred prayer\n[08:44.37]I was there I was there\n[08:46.98]\n[08:48.04]It was rare you remember it\n[08:50.98]\n[08:52.78]Wind in my hair\n[08:54.20]I was there I was there\n[08:56.94]\n[08:57.99]Down the stairs I was there\n[09:00.39]I was there\n[09:02.28]\n[09:02.96]Sacred prayer\n[09:04.19]I was there I was there\n[09:06.91]\n[09:08.10]It was rare you remember it\n[09:11.15]All too well", "trans": "[ti:All Too Well(10 Minute

它仍放在你的抽屉里\n[00:25.71]\n[00:35.53]目光追随着你的温柔甜蜜\n[00:40.57]\n[00:41.16]我们在车内高歌 沉溺于北方之旅\n[00:45.85]\n[00:46.36]秋日的落叶 片片飘落至地\n[00:50.48]时隔多年 我仍能在记忆中完整拼凑那幅画面\n[00:56.55]我知道一切已时过境迁
