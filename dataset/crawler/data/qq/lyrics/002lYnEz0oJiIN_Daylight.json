by：Taylor Swift\n[00:00.34]Composed by：Taylor Swift\n[00:00.52]My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in\n[00:07.55]Everyone looked worse in the light\n[00:13.04]There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven\n[00:20.19]I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye\n[00:26.95]I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\n[00:33.22]I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\n[00:39.93]I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night\n[00:45.16]And now I see daylight\n[00:48.35]I only see daylight\n[00:51.80]Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky\n[00:58.68]And so I became the butt of the joke\n[01:04.37]I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked\n[01:11.61]Clearing the air I breathed in the smoke\n[01:18.22]Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down\n[01:21.58]Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town\n[01:24.72]Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now\n[01:28.36]It's brighter now now\n[01:30.98]I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\n[01:35.68]I could never look away\n[01:37.26]I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\n[01:42.11]Things will never be the same\n[01:44.00]I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night\n[01:48.35]Now I'm wide awake\n[01:49.35]And now I see daylight\n[01:51.75]Daylight\n[01:52.82]I only see daylight\n[01:54.89]Daylight\n[01:55.66]I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n[02:01.93]I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n[02:09.96]And I could still see it all\n[02:11.87]In my mind\n[02:13.52]All of you all of me\n[02:14.92]Intertwined\n[02:16.52]I once believed love would be\n[02:18.12]Black and white\n[02:20.07]But it's golden\n[02:21.21]Golden\n[02:22.71]And I could still see it all\n[02:24.58]In my head\n[02:26.21]Back and forth from New York\n[02:27.72]Sneaking in your bed\n[02:29.38]I once believed love would be\n[02:31.03]Burning red\n[02:32.91]But it's golden\n[02:34.48]Golden\n[02:35.06]Daylight\n[02:37.10]Like daylight\n[02:41.01]Like daylight\n[02:44.59]Daylight\n[02:47.68]I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\n[02:52.80]I could never look away\n[02:54.04]I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\n[02:59.14]Things will never be the same\n[03:00.81]I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night\n[03:05.23]Now I'm wide awake\n[03:06.22]And now I see daylight\n[03:08.17]I see daylight\n[03:09.34]I only see daylight\n[03:11.45]Ah\n[03:12.41]I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n[03:18.75]I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n[03:23.07]Ah\n[03:25.21]I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n[03:31.64]I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n[03:41.03]Like daylight\n[03:45.26]It's golden\n[03:48.27]Like daylight\n[03:51.22]You gotta step into the daylight and let it go\n[03:57.33]Just let it go\n[04:00.41]Let it go\n[04:10.94]I want to be defined by the things that I love\n[04:14.70]Not the things I hate\n[04:16.56]Not the things that I'm afraid of I'm afraid of\n[04:19.45]The things that haunt me in the middle of the night\n[04:22.06]I\n[04:23.99]I just think that\n[04:27.86]You are what you love", "trans": "[ti:曙光]\n[ar:Taylor
