It says \"love is so short, forgetting is so long.\" It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.\n\nMy experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I\u2019d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I\u2019ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I\u2019ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.1. State Of Grace\nHidden message: I love you doesn't count after goodbye\n2.

we ar\u0435 again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember

It says \"love is so short, forgetting is so long.\" It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.\n\nMy experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I\u2019d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I\u2019ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I\u2019ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.1. State Of Grace\nHidden message: I love you doesn't count after goodbye\n2.

in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can

we ar\u0435 again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember

joint account\"\nNo, there ain't no doubt\nI think I'm gonna call him out\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]\nShe says, \"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it\"\nI think he did it, but I just

some brand new tires\nAnd his mistress moved in\nSleeps in Este's bed and everything\nNo, there ain't no doubt\nSomebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]\nI think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)\nI think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)\nI think he did it, but I just can't prove it\nNo, no body, no crime\nBut I ain't lettin' up until the day I die\n\n[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]\nNo, no\nI think he did it\nNo, no\nHe did it\n[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]\nGood thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen\nAnd I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene\nGood thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me\n(She was with me, dude)\nGood thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift]\nThey think she did it, but they just can't prove it\nThey think she did it, but they just can't prove it\nShe thinks I did it, but she just can't prove

said\nBut you'll find the real thing instead\nShe'll patch up your tapestry that I shred\n[Chorus]\nAnd hold your hand while dancing\nNever leave you standing\nCrestfallen on the landing\nWith

you\nI've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night\nAnd now I see daylight, I only see daylight\n\n[Verse 2]\nLuck of the draw only draws the unlucky\nAnd so I became the butt of the joke\nI wounded the good and I trusted the wicked\nClearing the air, I breathed in the smoke\nMaybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down\nMaybe I've stormed out of every single room in this

promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\nToo well\n[Verse 4]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by

end\nHow long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing\nSo what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways\nSo I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together\n\nI sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time\nSo I always wanna be prepared\nI wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said \"I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else\"\nSo I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called \"I Know Places\"\nSo this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song\n\n\"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:\n\nUh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i\n\nNa na na na waiting at the back door\nThey're around and the vultures come around\nAnd you know that they won't, they won't us\nSay what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us\nAnd you come and sing and listen\nI would not think about it but I'm not done\nEvery know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I\n'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes\nAnd guns\nThey are the hunters we are the foxes\nAnd we run\n\nBaby, I know some places we won't be found\nAnd they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down\nCause I, I know places we can hide\nI know places, I know places\n\nUh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places\"\n\nOr whatever\nI don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus\nSo I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing\nIt would be, like, [*vocalizing*]\nLike, very, like, beat.

end\nHow long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing\nSo what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways\nSo I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together\n\nI sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time\nSo I always wanna be prepared\nI wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said \"I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else\"\nSo I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called \"I Know Places\"\nSo this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song\n\n\"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:\n\nUh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i\n\nNa na na na waiting at the back door\nThey're around and the vultures come around\nAnd you know that they won't, they won't us\nSay what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us\nAnd you come and sing and listen\nI would not think about it but I'm not done\nEvery know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I\n'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes\nAnd guns\nThey are the hunters we are the foxes\nAnd we run\n\nBaby, I know some places we won't be found\nAnd they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down\nCause I, I know places we can hide\nI know places, I know places\n\nUh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places\"\n\nOr whatever\nI don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus\nSo I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing\nIt would be, like, [*vocalizing*]\nLike, very, like, beat.

end\nHow long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing\nSo what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways\nSo I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together\n\nI sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time\nSo I always wanna be prepared\nI wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said \"I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else\"\nSo I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called \"I Know Places\"\nSo this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song\n\n\"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:\n\nUh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i\n\nNa na na na waiting at the back door\nThey're around and the vultures come around\nAnd you know that they won't, they won't us\nSay what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us\nAnd you come and sing and listen\nI would not think about it but I'm not done\nEvery know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I\n'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes\nAnd guns\nThey are the hunters we are the foxes\nAnd we run\n\nBaby, I know some places we won't be found\nAnd they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down\nCause I, I know places we can hide\nI know places, I know places\n\nUh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places\"\n\nOr whatever\nI don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus\nSo I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing\nIt would be, like, [*vocalizing*]\nLike, very, like, beat.

after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle

I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again\nJust to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\nToo well\n[Verse 4]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it

life like it's a party and she's on the list\nShe looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it\nI think her ever-present frown is a little troubling\nAnd she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things\nBut sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know\nOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\nOh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me\nBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\n(Think about what you did)\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's not a saint and she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, whoa\nShe's better known for the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't make you many friends\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\nThere

known for the things that she does\nOn the mattress, whoa\nSoon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't make you many friends\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge, ha\n\n[Outro]\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing?\n'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)\nDo you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)\nI don't think you do, I don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause (Come on, come on)\nCome on, show me how much better you are\n(So much better, yeah?)\nSee you deserve some applause\n'Cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say \"Sabotage\"26Embed", "acousticness": 0.0167, "danceability": 0.519, "duration_ms": 217173, "energy": 0.917, "instrumentalness": 2.06e-05,

busy\nAnd you're doing your best to avoid me\nI'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us\nHow I was losing my mind when I saw you here\nBut you held your pride like you should've held me\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nOh, I'm scared to see the ending\nWhy are we pretending this is nothing?\nI'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how\nI've never heard silence quite this loud\n\n[Chorus]\nNow

battle's in your hands now\nBut I would lay my armor down\nIf you say you'd rather love than fight\nSo many things that you wish I knew\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm standing alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speaking\nAnd I'm dying to know\nIs it killing you like it's killing me?\nYeah, and I don't know what to say\nSince the twist of fate, when it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now\n\n[Outro]\nAnd we're not speaking\nAnd I'm dying to know\nIs it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?\nI don't know what to say

than revenge, ha\n[Verse 2]\nShe looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list\nShe looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it\nI think her ever-present frown is a little troubling\nAnd

you that in prep school so it's up to me\nBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\n(Think about what you did)\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's not a saint and she's not what you think\nShe's an actress,

make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n[Verse 2]\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStaying up, playing back myself leaving\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nAnd I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side and\nRealized I loved you in the fall\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd then the cold came\nThe dark days when fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Bridge]\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo if the chain is on your door, I understand\n[Chorus]\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December

around before\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell,

and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin 'round\nBut in your life you'll do things greater than\nDating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nI've found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to

doors\nIt's the mornin' of your very first day\nYou say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\n\"You know, I haven't seen you around before\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nFifteen\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough, you're best friends\nLaughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be outta here as soon as we can\nAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feelin' like flyin'\nAnd your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin 'round\nBut in your life you'll do things greater than\nDating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nI've found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to be\nAt fifteen\n[Post-Chorus]\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la,

you were throwing pebbles\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\nAnd I was crying on the staircase\nBegging you, \"Please don't go,\" and I said\n\n[Chorus]\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story, baby, just say \"Yes\"\n[Verse 2]\nSo I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe

this town\nHopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\n\"You know, I haven't seen you around before\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nFifteen\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough, you're best friends\nLaughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be outta here as soon as we can\nAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feelin' like flyin'\nAnd your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin 'round\nBut in your life you'll do things greater than\nDating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nI've found time can heal

1]\nYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\nIt's the mornin' of your very first day\nYou say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\n\"You know, I haven't seen you around before\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nFifteen\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough, you're best friends\nLaughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be outta here as soon as we can\nAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feelin' like flyin'\nAnd your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin 'round\nBut in your life you'll do things greater than\nDating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nI've found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to be\nAt fifteen\n[Post-Chorus]\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\n\n[Outro]\nYour very first day\nTake a deep breath, girl\nTake a deep breath as you

know you're not scared of anything at all\nDon't know if Snow White's house is near or far away\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm thirteen now\nAnd don't know how my friends could be so mean\nI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\nAnd we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away\nAnd we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school\nBut I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you\nDon't know how long it's going to take to feel okay\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\n[Bridge]\nI have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger\nGod smiles on my little brother, inside and out\nHe's better than I am\nI grew up in a pretty

fall\nI know you were on my side even when I was wrong\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\nFor staying back and watching me shine\nAnd I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to

waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said\nRomeo save me I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd said: \"Marry me Juliet\nYou'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to

the door with you, the air was cold\nBut somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh\n[Bridge]\nAnd maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nMaybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just

at six\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nI wore a dress\nYou wore a dark gray t-shirt\nYou told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess\nToday was a fairytale\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTime slows down\nWhenever you're around\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\nIt must have been the way\nToday was a fairytale\n[Verse 2]\nToday was a fairytale\nYou've got a smile\nThat takes me to another planet\nEvery move you make, everything you say is right\nToday was a fairytale\nToday was a fairytale\nAll that I can say\nIs now it's getting so much clearer\nNothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face\nToday was a fairytale\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTime slows down\nWhenever you're around, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love

heart\nIt's beating in my chest\nDid you feel it?\nI can't put this down\n[Breakdown]\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been the way\n\n[Chorus]\nBut can you feel this magic in the air?\nIt must have been the way you kissed me\nFell in love when I saw you standing there\nIt must have been

recognize me\nWell, it has been a year, it does not surprise me\nMerry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it\nWith a note saying 'I love you', I meant it\nNow I know what a fool I've been\nBut if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again\n\n[Chorus]\nLast Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI will give it to someone

tired eyes\nI am hiding from you and your soul of ice\nMy God, I thought you were someone to rely on\nMe, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\nA girl on a cover but you tore her apart\nMaybe this year\nMaybe this year I will give it to someone special\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause last Christmas I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day, you gave it away\nThis
