being hurt\n[Chorus]\nOh, academia, you can pick me up\nSoothe me with your words when I need your love\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion\nWill you listen to my

lover\n\n[Chorus]\nI am no good for you\nI'm seeing ghosts in everything I do\nI am no good for you\nI'm seeing ghosts in everything I do\nI am no good for you\nI'm seeing ghosts in everything I

me, lover\nWh\u0435n will you see that I am carrying this stuff?\nWalk away from me, lover\nAway from me, lover\nCan't you see that I am losing my marbles?\nIt's marvellous losing another\nLosing another\n\n[Chorus]\nI am no good for you\nI'm seeing ghosts in everything I do\nI am no good for you\nI'm seeing ghosts in everything I do\nI am no good for you\nI'm seeing ghosts in everything I
