Look, tell me, is it real?\nYep, real enough to go and get it tatted\nGive you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant\nI can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?\nIf you make

the time of year\nJB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare\nIt's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care\nWhen there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair\nIt's about time for you to act merrily\nIt's about time for you to give to charity\nRarely do people even wanna help at all\n'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls\nNot thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold\nWishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold\nSo I think some of you need to act bold\nGive a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe,

cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla\nBieber hit me back and said, \"Let's make it hot up in the winter\", I said \"Cool\"\nYou know I'ma deliver\nLet's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger\nBefore we work, I gotta get this off\nSee the other family members and drop gifts off\nThen I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how\nYou know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now\nPeople everywhere and all our Twitter followers\nMerry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nMary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum\nThe ox and lamb kept

for you to act merrily\nIt's about time for you to give to charity\nRarely do people even wanna help at all\n'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls\nNot thinkin' there's a family
